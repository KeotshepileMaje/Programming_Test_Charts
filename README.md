# Sedibelo Technology Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Sedibelo Technology Coding Challenge! This repository contains the source code for a web application developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We utilize the following libraries to enhance functionality:

- **fuse.js**: A lightweight fuzzy-search library that enables efficient searching within large datasets.
- **Chart.js**: A flexible and feature-rich JavaScript charting library for data visualization.

## Website Structure

The website consists of three main pages:

1. **Home Page**: This page serves as the entry point to the application. It features a navigation bar that directs users to the two main sections of the application.

   Visit the Home Page: [Sedibelo Tech - Home](https://programming-test-charts.vercel.app/)

2. **Chart Page**: This page displays various charts generated from data. It provides visual representations of datasets using Chart.js, allowing for easy data analysis and interpretation.

   Visit the Chart Page: [Sedibelo Tech - Charts](https://programming-test-charts.vercel.app/charts.html)

3. **Table Page**: This page presents tabular data in a structured format. Users can view and interact with data tables to analyze information efficiently.
